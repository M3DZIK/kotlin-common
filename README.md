# Kotlin Common

This Kotlin library provides a collection of reusable libraries that offer common functionalities.

For example, this library includes various modules that provide commonly used utilities, extensions, 
and abstractions for Kotlin development. These modules can be used across different projects, 
reducing development time and improving code quality.

## Getting started

Add the library as a dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>dev.medzik.common</groupId>
        <artifactId>kotlin</artifactId>
        <version>1.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
